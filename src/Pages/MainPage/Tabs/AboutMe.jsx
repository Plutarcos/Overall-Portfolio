                    <p>i am someone who can't stand in one place,
                        always trying to do as much as i can to create things and solve problems (as any nerdy kid does).</p>

                    <p>Since i was a little kid, i've always loved to create things (slingshots, drawings, DIY toys, etc.)
                        and as a 2000's child, i grew up in front of a computer. At 8 years old i was testing all i could test
                        on Windows xp, that's when i found a Game Engine named 'FPS Creator'. Although simple, i was fascinated
                        with the thought that i could create more than just drawings and audio recordings of myself on my computer,
                        i could create the most present thing in my life, GAMES!</p>

                    <p>That's how all of this starded, with some awlful games made in FPS Creator. in 2010 i've met
                        RPG Maker, another Game Engine which provides tools to develop JRPG games. A few years later
                        i got a new computer which could run Unity Engine, and that was the moment i fell into the
                        programming world.</p>

                    <p>With Unity Engine, i've learned the basics of JavaScript and C# (At least enought to make
                        a few 2D platform games, FPS, TPS, i even got the chance to develop a Mobile VR game in which
                        the player had to avoid obstacles on a road. i was 14 years old at the time and at the peak
                        of my creativity, so i used all the tools i could found to create.
                    </p>

                    <p>i needed artwork for the games, so i've learned Photoshop. Then i needed publicity videos
                        to share my games on youtube and groups, so i started to learn video editing (with Vegas Pro and Adobe Premiere).
                        The music and sound effect for my games i made with some instruments and audio editing and mixing. The more
                        i used in my games, the more i needed to learn new things, and that's how i got into web developing too.
                    </p>

                    <p>in 2020, after finishing my System Analysis an Development course, i created MilltopLabs.
                        it was important to me, although it isn't a proper company yet, i finally got courage to
                        start developing games for other people rather than my family and friends.
